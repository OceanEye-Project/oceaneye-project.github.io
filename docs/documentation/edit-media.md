You can efficiently manage and view your project's media with the Edit Media dialog. Select images from the grid to remove them individually, or clear all media from your project. 

#### Removing Media
When you remove media, the annotation information is deleted. 

- **Internal Media**: When you remove media stored within the project's directory (e.g., sliced video frames), the corresponding files are permanently deleted.
- **External Media**: Media imported from outside the project's directory will be removed from the project but remain in their original location.
