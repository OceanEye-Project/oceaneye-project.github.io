Annotations can be exported via the `File > Import Annotations` menu.

Currently, the only supported format is COCO. COCO is supported by popular dataset repositories such as [Roboflow](https://universe.roboflow.com/) and [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets).

To import annotations, images must be in the same folder as the COCO annotation file.
