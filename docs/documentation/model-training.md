# Model Training
It is reccomended to use a [CUDA-capable GPU](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus). CUDA can be downloaded [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads). While training on a CPU is supported, it may result in significantly longer training times.

Model training requires additional dependencies, which are automatically installed during the initial training process with OceanEye.

It is recommended to have at least 200 annotations per class before initiating training. For optimal results, having over 1,000 annotations per class is strongly encouraged.
